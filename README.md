# LIB_Supply-Chain
This study investigates the environmental and economic benefits of second life and recycling across three promising lithium-ion batteries. There are three folders under this repository:
1. Characterization factors
2. LCIA results
3. Sensitivity analysis

## 1. Characterization factors
There are 7 excel files in this folder, representing characterization factors for the pre-pandemic power grid configuration in 2019 and power grid projection in 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050. 

## 2. LCIA results
There are 4 excel files in this folder:
### LCIA results_BAU/LCIA results_Reshoring/LCIA results_Ally-shoring:
These files aggregate the bulky list of LCIA results for BAU, reshoring, and ally-shoring scenarios, respectively, which are used to plot Fig. 4a-d, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Fig. 5.

### LCIA results_projected figures:
This file presents the summarized LCIA results of the projected BAU, reshoring, and ally-shoring scenarios in 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050, respectively, which are used to plot Fig.4e-g. 

## 3. Sensitivity analysis
There are one excel file in this folder:
### Sensitivity analysis
The first tab "Recycling parameters" of this file focuses on sensitivity analysis on Recycling parameters of three recycling methods for LMO, NCM and NCA LIBs, respectively. The upperbound, lowerbound and baseline parameters and their corresponding results of carbon footprint, cumulative energy demand and environmental scores are summarized in the three tables. Supplementary Fig. S11-S13 are depicted based on these results. 

The second tab "Temporal and spatial variation" of this file focuses on sensitivity analysis on temporal and spatial varaition in electricity generation from 2020 t0 2050 projected by EIA. The two regions of this study are the United States and China. Supplementary Fig. S15 depicts the projected energy sources for the U.S. and China from 2020 to 2050 by EIA, which are listed as Table 1 and 2. Fig. 7 are plotted based on these sensitivity analysis results summarized in Table 3-8.
