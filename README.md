# LIB_Supply-Chain
This study examines the long-term energy and sustainability prospects of the current trend towards bolstering a secure and resilient midstream and downstream value chain of EV batteries for the US. There are three folders under this repository:
1. Characterization factors
2. LCI
3. LCIA results

## 1. Characterization factors
There are 7 excel files in this folder, representing characterization factors for the pre-pandemic power grid configuration in 2019 and power grid projection in 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050. 

## 2. LCI
There is 1 excel file in this folder, including the LCI for 2019 US EV fleet, EV projection from 2025 to 2050 every 5 years, and transportation. 

## 3. LCIA results
There are 6 excel files in this folder:

### LCIA results_TAU:
This file aggregates the bulky list of LCIA results for the US EV fleet case, reshoring, and ally-shoring scenarios with technology as usual, which are used to plot Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

### LCIA results_BAU/LCIA results_Reshoring/LCIA results_Ally-shoring:
These files aggregate the bulky list of LCIA results for BAU, reshoring, and ally-shoring scenarios, respectively, which are used to plot Fig. 4a-d, Supplementary Fig. 4, and Supplementary Fig. 5.

### LCIA results_projected figures:
This file presents the summarized LCIA results of the projected BAU, reshoring, and ally-shoring scenarios in 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050, respectively, which are used to plot Fig.4e-g. 

### LCIA_results_breakdown:
This file further aggregates the LCIA results from processes into life cycle stages for the projected BAU, reshoring, and ally-shoring scenarios in 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and 2050, respectively.
